Deserv
======
>A simple development server written in Go

Intended to provide functionality similar to the ones listed [here][gist]. It
provides directory listings and that's about it in terms of bells and whistles.

I made it because I work with Windows users who don't necessarily have anything
cool installed on their machines. The compiled binary can be *double-clicked* to
start, and does exactly what they need.
