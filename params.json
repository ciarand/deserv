It\r\nprovides directory listings and that's about it in terms of bells and whistles.\r\n\r\nI made it because I work with Windows users who don't necessarily have anything\r\ncool installed on their machines. The compiled binary can be *double-clicked* to\r\nstart, and does exactly what they need.\r\n\r\n[gist]: https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n--------\r\nShould be `go get`-able.\r\n```\r\ngo get github.com/ciarand/deserv\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo update, run it with the `-u` flag.\r\n```\r\ngo get -u github.com/ciarand/deserv\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n```\r\n# port is optional, defaults to 3000\r\n# \"public\" is the directory to serve from - defaults to .\r\n./deserve -port 8080 public\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
