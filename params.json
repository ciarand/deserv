It\r\nprovides pretty directory listings, but that's about it in terms of bells and\r\nwhistles.\r\n\r\nI made it because I work with Windows users who don't necessarily have anything\r\ncool installed on their machines. The compiled binary can be *double-clicked* to\r\nstart, and does exactly what they need.\r\n\r\nIf you need anything heavier, I recommend getting something heavier.\r\n\r\n[gist]: https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n1. This is not a production web server.\r\n2. This is not a production web server.\r\n3. This is not a production web server.\r\n\r\nTests\r\n-----\r\nThere aren't any. Deal with it. You can still run `make test` if you like.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo test\r\n?       github.com/ciarand/deserv   [no test files]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n--------\r\nShould be `go get`-able.\r\n```\r\ngo get github.com/ciarand/deserv\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo update, run it with the `-u` flag.\r\n```\r\ngo get -u github.com/ciarand/deserv\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterested in compiling for multiple platforms? I use [`goxc`][goxc]. If you\r\nhave it installed and in your path, running `make compile` should create a dump\r\nof all the possible versions in the `snapshots` directory. If you need more fine\r\ngrained control then do it yourself, I'm not your mother.\r\n\r\n[goxc]: https://github.com/laher/goxc\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n```\r\n# port is optional, defaults to 3000\r\n# \"public\" is the directory to serve from - defaults to .\r\n./deserve -port 8080 public\r\n```\r\n\r\nLibraries\r\n---------\r\nDeserv is built with [Go][]. This means that it can be run basically anywhere,\r\nas near as I can tell.\r\n\r\nDeserv is also built on the [Martini][] framework. If you're interested in\r\nworking on web applications in Go, I highly recommend investigating it.\r\n\r\nFinally, the directory index middleware that was developed for this project is\r\navailable [here][middleware].\r\n\r\n[middleware]: https://github.com/ciarand/martini-fileindex\r\n[martini]: https://github.com/codegangsta/martini\r\n[go]: http://golang.org/\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nMIT, see the [license file][license].\r\n\r\n[license]: /LICENSE\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
